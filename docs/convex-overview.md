I want you to take a look at the Claude code log files and the schema for Claude code. And I want you to help me design a schema for my Convex app. So the idea here is that I want to store from the UI, I want the user to be able to browse a list of conversations. And be able to just like, the conversations should be in a list that are all toggles that are closed by default. In each conversation should have like, the name of the conversation which I think is generated by Claude code as the title on the outside of the toggle. And then when you open the toggle, it should show a list of prompts that the user has sent inside of that conversation.


Keep in mind that the `sampleData` we have right now and the schema we have for Convex is all dummy data and it's not important, so I will leave it up to you to update that for the schema necessary to do what is described here. Don't add a bunch of extra stuff and keep it pretty minimal.

If you need to browse to see the other part of this project which is `ClaudeCode` Hooks, feel free to look here: ~/.claude/hooks/n8n




// claude code logs docs:
What Claude Code writes (formats + paths)
1) Session transcripts (conversation logs)

Format: JSON Lines (.jsonl). Each line is a JSON object representing a message or event. Event types include "user", "assistant", tool use, and checkpoints. Example (from docs):

{"type":"user","uuid":"abc123","timestamp":"2024-01-01T10:00:00Z","message":{"content":"Hello Claude"}}
{"type":"assistant","uuid":"def456","parentUuid":"abc123","timestamp":"2024-01-01T10:00:01Z","message":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"Hello! How can I help?"}]}}
{"type":"checkpoint","sessionId":"session123","commit":"a1b2c3d","timestamp":"2024-01-01T10:00:02Z","label":"Initial state","id":"chk456"}


Docs explicitly call the transcript format JSONL and enumerate these event kinds.

Location (SDK guide):
~/.config/claude/projects/{project-hash}/{session-id}.jsonl
with metadata in ~/.config/claude/sessions/sessions.json. 
Anthropic

Location (hooks reference):
Hook payloads expose transcript_path, shown as ~/.claude/projects/.../{session-id}.jsonl (indicates some builds use ~/.claude/â€¦). Treat both as valid depending on install/channel. 
Anthropic

Retention: A cleanupPeriodDays setting controls how long local chat transcripts are kept (default 30 days).

Headless/CLI streaming: Headless mode can read/write stream-JSON or JSONL for programmatic usage (--input-format/--output-format include stream-json); docs explicitly mention jsonl message formatting.

2) Session metadata

Format: JSON. Stored in sessions.json with fields like id, status, timestamps, projectPath, and transcriptPath. Used for resume/continue behavior.

3) Settings (configuration)

Format: JSON.

User: ~/.claude/settings.json

Project (checked-in): .claude/settings.json

Project (local, git-ignored): .claude/settings.local.json

Enterprise managed policies:
macOS: /Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json
Linux/WSL: /etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json
Windows: C:\ProgramData\ClaudeCode\managed-settings.json

Notes: docs list supported keys (e.g., permissions, env, outputStyle, model, cleanupPeriodDays).

Client integration lives under `src/app/`.

Convex schema
- conversations: sessionId string
- prompts: conversationId Id<"conversations">, prompt string, timestamp number
- ai_prompts: conversationId Id<"conversations">, ai_prompt string, timestamp number

Convex functions
- conversations.list: query, returns all conversations
- conversations.upsert: mutation, ensures a conversation exists by sessionId
- conversations.addPrompt: mutation, upserts conversation then inserts into prompts and/or ai_prompts
- prompts.listForConversation: query, returns prompts for a conversation
- ai_prompts.listForConversation: query, returns AI prompts for a conversation

Hook integration
- POST /api/update-convex with body:
  - session_id: string (required)
  - prompt: string (optional)
  - ai_prompt: string (optional)
  - transcript_summary: string (optional)
  - At least one of prompt or ai_prompt is required
